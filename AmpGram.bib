  abstract = {Amyloids are proteins associated with several clinical disorders, including Alzheimer's, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob's. Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by short segments called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on their more general properties, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form {$\beta$}-sheets, and lower flexibility of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were previously confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as the web-server:

  volume = {33},

  abstract = {Motivation: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are innate immune molecules that exhibit activities against a range of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa. Recent increases in microbial resistance against current drugs has led to a concomitant increase in the need for novel antimicrobial agents. Over the last decade, a number of AMP prediction tools have been designed and made freely available online. These AMP prediction tools show potential to discriminate AMPs from non-AMPs, but the relative quality of the predictions produced by the various tools is difficult to quantify.
Results: We compiled two sets of AMP and non-AMP peptides, separated into three categories-antimicrobial, antibacterial and bacteriocins. Using these benchmark data sets, we carried out a systematic evaluation of ten publicly available AMP prediction methods. Among the six general AMP prediction tools-ADAM, CAMPR3(RF), CAMPR3(SVM), MLAMP, DBAASP and MLAMP-we find that CAMPR3(RF) provides a statistically significant improvement in performance, as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, relative to the other five methods. Surprisingly, for antibacterial prediction, the original AntiBP method significantly outperforms its successor, AntiBP2 based on one benchmark dataset. The two bacteriocin prediction tools, BAGEL3 and BACTIBASE, both provide very good performance and BAGEL3 outperforms its predecessor, BACTIBASE, on the larger of the two benchmarks.

  issn = {1422-0067},
  abstract = {Signal peptides are N-terminal presequences responsible for targeting proteins to the endomembrane system, and subsequent subcellular or extracellular compartments, and consequently condition their proper function. The significance of signal peptides stimulates development of new computational methods for their detection. These methods employ learning systems trained on datasets comprising signal peptides from different types of proteins and taxonomic groups. As a result, the accuracy of predictions are high in the case of signal peptides that are well-represented in databases, but might be low in other, atypical cases. Such atypical signal peptides are present in proteins found in apicomplexan parasites, causative agents of malaria and toxoplasmosis. Apicomplexan proteins have a unique amino acid composition due to their AT-biased genomes. Therefore, we designed a new, more flexible and universal probabilistic model for recognition of atypical eukaryotic signal peptides. Our approach called signalHsmm includes knowledge about the structure of signal peptides and physicochemical properties of amino acids. It is able to recognize signal peptides from the malaria parasites and related species more accurately than popular programs. Moreover, it is still universal enough to provide prediction of other signal peptides on par with the best preforming predictors.},

  abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), naturally encoded from genes and generally contained 10\textendash{}100 amino acids, are crucial components of the innate immune system and can protect the host from various pathogenic bacteria, as well as viruses. In recent years, the widespread use of antibiotics has inspired the rapid growth of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms that usually induce critical infection and pathogenesis. An increasing interest therefore was motivated to explore natural AMPs that enable the development of new antibiotics. With the potential of AMPs being as new drugs for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we were thus motivated to develop a database (dbAMP, http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/dbAMP/) by accumulating comprehensive AMPs from public domain and manually curating literature. Currently in dbAMP there are 12 389 unique entries, including 4271 experimentally verified AMPs and 8118 putative AMPs along with their functional activities, supported by 1924 research articles. The advent of high-throughput biotechnologies, such as mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing, has led us to further expand dbAMP as a database-assisted platform for providing comprehensively functional and physicochemical analyses for AMPs based on the large-scale transcriptome and proteome data. Significant improvements available in dbAMP include the information of AMP\textendash{}protein interactions, antimicrobial potency analysis for `cryptic' region detection, annotations of AMP target species, as well as AMP detection on transcriptome and proteome datasets. Additionally, a Docker container has been developed as a downloadable package for discovering known and novel AMPs on high-throughput omics data. The user-friendly visualization interfaces have been created to facilitate peptide searching, browsing, and sequence alignment against dbAMP entries. All the facilities integrated into dbAMP can promote the functional analyses of AMPs and the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs.},
